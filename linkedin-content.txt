POST 2: Thought Leadership

Hot take: The best developers in 2026 won't be those who write the most code.

They'll be the ones who know how to leverage AI to amplify their impact.

At Bitrize Plus, we've watched teams transform:
• Junior devs performing at senior levels
• Small startups shipping like enterprises
• Enterprise teams moving at startup speed

The secret? AI agents that handle the 80% of repetitive work so humans can focus on the 20% that requires creativity.

This isn't about replacing developers. It's about giving every developer superpowers.

What's your take on AI in development? 👇

POST 3: Customer Success

A 5-person startup just shipped what used to take a 20-person team.

How? They used Bitrize Plus.

Here's what happened:
📍 Started with just an idea
📍 IdeaForge AI validated market fit in 48 hours
📍 SpecGen Agent created full technical specs
📍 CodePilot AI generated 80% of the codebase
📍 TestGuard AI achieved 95% coverage
📍 LaunchMate AI handled zero-downtime deployment

Total time from idea to production: 6 weeks.

This is the power of AI-augmented development.

If you're still building the old way, you're leaving massive opportunities on the table.
